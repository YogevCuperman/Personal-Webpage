How to run the website: double-click on index.html

Input validation: At the "Contact Me" section, the JS code validats the following:
- First name and last name both contain only english letters and at least 2 characters.
- Phone number is valid (contain 7 digits without the prefix and only made of digits).

I used a bootstrap theme from bootswatch.com - the specific class is linked to the html file using <link> tag.
